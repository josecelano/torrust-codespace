# Torrust Tracker Codespace

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=573100409)

[GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for Torrust tracker.

[Torrust](https://torrust.com/) is a GitHub organization that builds BitTorrent-related software using Rust. You can find the official documentation for the project at <https://torrust.com/>. But It does not include yet a tutorial for new developers who want to contribute.

This repo contains two tutorials that will help you to set up your dev environment in two different ways:

- Using your machine with the pre-installed dependencies.
- Using this repository. It helps you to set up a GitHub Codespace on your Visual Studio Code.

> NOTICE: it does work for [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) on the cloud. You can read more on this [issue](https://github.com/josecelano/torrust-codespace/issues/1).
